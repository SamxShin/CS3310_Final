# CS3310 Final

This project contains solutions to these three coding problems:

1. You are given an array of integers (both positive and negative values). Find the contiguous sequence with the largest sum.

EXAMPLE
Input: 2, -8, 3, -2, 4, -10
Output: 5    which is the sequence [3, -2, 4]

This solution can be found in the file named "ContiguousLargestSum.java"

Time Complexity:  O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)




2. Given 2 very large binary trees T1 and T2. Create an algorithm to deter-mine if T2 is a subtree of T1. Assume T1 is always much larger than T2

This solution can be found in the file named "SubTreeProblem.java"

Time Complexity:    O(n * m)

Space Complexity:   O(log(n) + log(m))




3. Given an NxN matrix of positive and negative integers, find the submatrix with the largest possible sum

This solution can be found in the file named "SubmatrixProblem.java"
Time Complexity:  O(n^3)
Space Complexity: O(n)
